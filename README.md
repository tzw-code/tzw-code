- 👋 Hi, I’m @tzw-code
- 👀 I’m interested in cryptography, security protocols, federated learning, and data privacy protection.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning advanced techniques in cryptographic protocols and exploring the latest research in federated learning to address privacy concerns in machine learning.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on security-related research, especially projects that involve data privacy, encryption algorithms, or distributed learning systems.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I once spent an entire weekend debugging a simple cryptographic algorithm, only to realize I had missed a tiny typo! 😅
